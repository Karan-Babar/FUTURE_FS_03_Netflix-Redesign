For this task, I built a fully responsive Netflix Redesign web application, focusing on modern UI, smooth interactions, and cross-device responsiveness.


🔧 Tech Stack Used:

 ✨ Frontend: Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS
 
 ✨ UI & Icons: React Icons
 
 ✨ Backend Services: Firebase 
 
 ✨ Deployment: Vercel


📌 Key Features:

 ✔ Fully responsive design (mobile, tablet & desktop)
 
 ✔ Netflix-style UI with hero sections, movie rows & smooth scrolling
 
 ✔ Horizontal scroll movie rows with hover effects
